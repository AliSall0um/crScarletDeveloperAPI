# crScarletDeveloperAPI
crScarlet is a tool which will allow store to sign Scarlet securely.
There are many changes that will be made to allow for ad-revanue on those who will host Scarlet.

An example of what the crscarlet request file looks like is on the root of the project.
This file is self-explanatory ; move it to the root directory of the Scarlet app and change the values if needed.

# NOTICE
Although this code can be used and modified by ANYBODY this doesn't mean hosting Scarlet out of the usescarlet.com domain is allowed.
During the full release of crscarlet stores are required to install Scarlet using a special link which will setup and install crscarlet.
Any occurences of Scarlet installed outside of this will fail(when the cryptography system is put in place). 
You will be contacted if the use is being exploited or mis-used ; this will result in a DMCA notice and can be further escalated.

Those interested in hosting prior to official release or outside our domain must contact @DebianArch on Twitter for written permission.
