# crScarletDeveloperAPI
crScarlet is a tool which will allow store to sign Scarlet securely.
There are many changes that will be made to allow for ad-revanue on those who will host Scarlet.
For now this is how the API works and it's very easy to deliver and use.

An example of what the crscarlet request file looks like is on the root of the project.
This file is self-explanatory ; move it to the root directory of the Scarlet app and change the values if needed.
